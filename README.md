Aggregate data from a few federal websites to get complete picture of federal rules issued since ?

This is a collection of files that puts together a csv with data on rules issued by all federal agencies going well back into the 80 - although it may not be reliable until the 90s - I forget what the data limitations are. The finished csv is included. I had intended to use this to examine how federal agencies might strategically delay rule implementation to negotiate with the President and OIRA. A draft of the research was presented at MPSA 2012 (maybe?) but I never pursued it further.
